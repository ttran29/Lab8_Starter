## How are graceful degradation and service workers related?
### Graceful degradation is where you build the app and it can still function properly even when you lose network connection. Service workers is where you can aid this by enabling web applications to function without the network connection. To do this, the app will show the things that were saved before. Both of these things help make the application reliable while keeping it UI friendly. Altogether, it is like a backup plan that guarantees that the user can use the app without any network connection.
